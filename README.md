## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [[https://github.com/shri-ui/Assignment-submission-portal.git]]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   If your project requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your variables. For example:

   ```plaintext
   # .env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

   Start the server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Alternatively, if you are using `nodemon` for development:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## Testing with Postman

1. **Install Postman:**

   If you haven't already, download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

2. **Import API Collection:**

   If you have a Postman collection file, import it into Postman. Otherwise, manually create requests for your API endpoints.

3. **Set Environment Variables:**

   If your API requires specific environment variables, set them in Postman. This can be done in the "Environments" tab.

4. **Send Requests:**

   Use Postman to send requests to your API endpoints. For example, to test a GET request:

   - Select the GET method.
   - Enter the URL, e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/your-endpoint`.
   - Click "Send" to execute the request.

5. **Check Responses:**

   Verify the responses to ensure your API is working as expected. Check status codes, response bodies, and headers.
